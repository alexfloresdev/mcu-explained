				The Marvel Cinematic Universe (often referred to as the MCU) is comprised of 20 interconnected movies (with more on the way), organized into three separate "phases," centered on the stories of over 20 different comic book characters (with more on the way) who originate in the pages of Marvel Comics
			</p>
			<p>
				While other movies have been made by different movie studios based on comic book characters who also originate in Marvel Comics, the MCU has thus far been the most successful attempt at creating a series of interconnected movies that both tell the individual stories of their characters while simultaneously connecting those stories to a larger narrative that expands across multiple movies
			</p>
			<p>
				The 15+ movies of the MCU are made by the Disney owned company, Marvel Studios. Marvel Studios is led by current president and all around awesome guy, Kevin Feige
