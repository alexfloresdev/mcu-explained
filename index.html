				The Marvel Cinematic Universe (often referred to as the MCU) is comprised of 20 interconnected movies (with more on the way), organized into three separate "phases," centered on the stories of over 20 different comic book characters (with more on the way) who originate in the pages of Marvel Comics
			</p>
			<p>
				While other movies have been made by different movie studios based on comic book characters who also originate in Marvel Comics, the MCU has thus far been the most successful attempt at creating a series of interconnected movies that both tell the individual stories of their characters while simultaneously connecting those stories to a larger narrative that expands across multiple movies
			</p>
			<p>
				The 20+ movies of the MCU are made by the Disney owned company, Marvel Studios. Marvel Studios is led by current president and all around awesome guy, Kevin Feige.

						<li>Since the events of the Avengers, Captain America has been working as an agent of SHIELD and his skill in battle has greatly improved as a result</li>
						
						<li>Nick Fury introduces Captain America to an upgraded form of Helicarrier which can target and eliminate potential threats before they can commit the crime</li>

						<li>Dr. Arnim Zola returns to reveal that he has been secretly advancing Hydra's cause from within the organization of SHIELD as far back as SHIELD's very beginning.  Hydra's cause is to motivate citizens to willfully give up more of their freedom in exchange for greater security.</li>

						<li>Captain America and team confront the Winter Soldier where they learn his true identity is Bucky Barnes - Steve's bestfriend from the 1940s formerly presumed to be killed in battle long ago.</li>
						
						<li>Since Steve last saw Bucky Barnes, Bucky has been working as a brainwashed agent of Hydra under the codename of the Winter Soldier. Bucky survived his fall from the train due to the experiments performed on him during the first Captain America film and since then has been frozen in ice and periodically unfrozen only to perform missions for Hydra.</li>
						
						<li>Captain America, Nick Fury, Black Widow, the Falcon and other various SHIELD agents work together to stop the launch of the upgraded Helicarriers</li>

					<h4>Character Events</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>In a flashback to the early nineties, we learn that there are activation codes for Bucky Barnes' Winter Soldier brainwashing.  In addition we see Bucky execute a mission to steal a supply of the super-soldier serum</li>
						
						
						<li>In present day, the Avengers are on a stealth mission to stop one of Captain America's former allies from stealing a biological weapon.  In the process, Wanda fails to prevent a bomb from going off which leads to a part of a building being destroyed and several innocent Wakandan humanitarian workers being killed as a result</li>
						
						<li>Now Secretary of State, Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross returns to inform the Avengers that they must submit to UN supervision.  As a result of the collatarel damage from the recent Avengers-related battles, Ross informs the Avengers that the United Nations intend to pass the Sokovia Accords which will establish a UN panel to oversee and deploy the Avengers as they see fit.</li>
						
						<li>The Avengers are split over the decision to submit to UN supervision.  Feeling guilty for his role in creating Ultron and the devastation it brought to Sokovia, Tony Stark believes they should submit.  Captain America, having just survived the infiltration of SHIELD by Hydra, believes they will cease to be the Avengers if they submit.</li>
						
						<li>Peggy Carter passes away and Steve Rogers attends the funeral in the UK</li>
						
						<li>Zemo steals the activation codes for Bucky's Winter Soldier brainwashing program</li>
						
						<li>Scarlet Witch discovers that she is being held in house arrest at the Avengers facility under supervision of The Vision.  In addition, she learns that The Vision may have stronger feelings for her.</li>
						
						<li>T'challa's father and the King of Wakanda, T'chaka, is killed in a terrorist bombing for which Bucky Barnes aka the Winter Soldier is implicated as responsible</li>
						
						<li>Believing Bucky is innocent, Captain America and the Falcon  track down Bucky. At this same time the Black Panther is in pursuit of Bucky Barnes to avenge his father's death.  War Machine steps in and stops Captain America, the Falcon, Black Panther and Bucky is apprehended.</li>
						
						<li>Tony almost convinces Steve to join the UN supervised Avengers until Steve learns that Wanda is being held against her will at the Avengers facility</li>
						
						<li>While in custody, Zemo impersonates the psychiatrist sent to interview Bucky and uses the Winter Soldier activation codes to put Bucky back into his brainwashed state as the Winter Soldier.  Captain America tries to save Bucky from himself while the other Avengers unsuccessfully try to stop Bucky.</li>
						
						<li>Captain America and the Falcon escape with Bucky and learn there exists a more aggressive group of Hydra soldiers also brainwashed with the Winter Soldier programming and enhanced with the same super soldier serum which Bucky stole in the early nineties.</li>
						
						<li>
						  In thinking that Zemo intends to awaken these more aggressive Winter Soldiers, Captain America and The Falcon seek to put together a team of individuals who can help confront the threat.  As a result, Hawkeye retrieves Scarlet Witch from the Avengers facility and picks up Scott Lang, aka Ant-Man, along the way.
						</li>
						
						<li>Given a limited amount of time by Thaddeus Ross, Tony Stark puts together a team to bring Captain America in once and for all.  This team is comprised of Black Widow, War Machine, The Vision, Black Panther and a new up and coming superhero known as Spider-Man</li>
						
						<li>Tony Stark personally recruits Spider-Man to help bring Captain America and his team in </li>
						
						<li>Both teams face-off at an airport in Leipzig and only by Ant-Man turning into Giant-Man and Black Widow betraying her own team are Bucky and Captain America able to barely escape in a Quinjet.  In addition, War Machine becomes a victim of friendly fire due to a miscalculation on part of The Vision. As result War Machine falls from a great height and receives a severe spinal injury. </li>
						
						<li>Ant-Man, Scarlet Witch, Hawkeye and the Falcon are imprisoned in a specially made prison known as the Raft.  Tony allows Black Widow to go into hiding rather than become a prisoner as a result of her betrayal in the fight.</li>
						
						<li>Tony learns that Bucky wasn't the one responsible for the bombing in Vienna and with the help of The Falcon, tracks down Captain America and Bucky to the Siberian Hydra facility with the intent to help them.  Unknown to Tony, T'Challa is following close behind.</li>
						
						<li>Instead of confronting a group of more aggressive Winter Soldiers at the Hydra facility, Zemo shows Bucky, Steve and Tony security footage of Bucky acquiring the super soldier serum in the early nineties. In this video Tony witnesses his parents killed by Bucky.  Once Tony learns that Captain America knew that Bucky was responsible for his parent's death, Tony turns on both of them focusing his efforts on killing Bucky.</li>
						
						<li>Upon learning that Zemo was responsible for the UN bombing and also just a man seeking revenge, T'Challa decides to not take revenge and instead apprehends Zemo to answer for his crimes.</li>
						
						<li>Captain America and Bucky are successful in stopping Tony from killing them both, however Bucky loses his robotic arm in the process and Captain America gives his shield back to the Stark family by the insistence of Tony.</li>
						
						<li>Zemo is put into custody and questioned by Everett Ross. Zemo sees his plan as a success.</li>
						
						<li>Tony returns to Avengers facility where he is helping War Machine rehabilite with some of his modern Stark technology and receives a package from Captain America.  Captain America has sent a letter and a cellphone apologizing for his part in events that led to their confrontation and saying that if Tony ever needed help that he would be there.</li>
						  
						<li>Captain America breaks Ant-Man, Scarlet Witch, Hawkeye and the Falcon out of imprisonment on the Raft.</li>
						
						<li>T'challa provides asylum for Bucky Barnes and Captain America in Wakanda</li>

						<li>Nebula has been captured and imprisoned by an alien race known as the Sovereign.  In exchange for preventing an inter-dimensional monster from consuming the batteries of the Sovereign, the guardians take Nebula into their custody.</li>

						<li>Rocket needlessly steals very valuable batteries from the Sovereign. As a result, the Sovereign are in pursuit of the Guardians.  Being a race of people that take themselves very seriously, the Sovereign seeks to destroy the Guardians of the Galaxy.</li>
						
						<li>The Guardians are saved by Quill's father Ego, but having sustained damage to their ship crash land on a nearby planet.</li>
						
						<li>Ego catches up with the Guardians and convinces Quill, Gamora and Drax to go back with him and Mantis to his planet.  In their conversation, Peter learns that Yondu was originally supposed to take him to Ego when he was abducted long ago as a child. Rocket, Groot and Nebula stay behind while Rocket makes repairs to the ship.</li>
						
						<li>On their way to Ego's planet Drax and Starlord get to know Mantis and learn that she has the power to sense the feelings of others as well create feelings in others.  Ego keeps her around because she can help him sleep.</li>
						
						<li>The Sovereign hire Yondu Udonta to find the Guardians of the Galaxy and bring them back to answer for their crimes against the Sovereign.</li>
						
						<li>Yondu tracks down Rocket, Groot and Nebula but when he decides to betray the Sovereign and sell the batteries instead of capturing the Guardians, Yondu's crew of Ravagers mutiny.  In an attempt to help Rocket facing off with the Ravagers, Baby Groot releases Nebula who sides with the Ravagers and knocks Yondu and Rocket unconscious.</li>
						
						<li>Ego, Mantis, Starlord, Gamora and Drax arrive on Ego's unusual planet where he and Mantis are the sole inhabitants.  There Starlord gets to know his father and discovers that his father is a Celestial and that he also carries the Celestial gene which is why he could hold the Power Stone in the last film and not die.</li>
						
						<li>Imprisoned on the Ravagers ship, Nebula indirectly saves Rocket and Yondu's life by not allowing the Ravagers to kill them. Nebula flies off in a Ravager ship vowing to take revenge on Gamora, then Thanos.</li>

Rocket, Baby Groot, Kraglin and Yondu escape in a different component of the ship.  As they escape, the Ravager which led the mutiny sends a message informing the Sovereign where they can find the Guardians.</li>
						
						<li>Rocket enters the coordinates for Ego's planet and they fly off to Ego as fast as possible.  Rocket's urgency is based on his sense of Ego based on the earlier conversation Yondu and Rocket had in prison.</li>
						
						
						<li>Nebula finds Gamora on Ego's planet and in a failed attempt to kill Gamora, they both discover the bones of Ego's many children who ended up not carrying the Celestial gene. In this fight Nebula reveals that the reason she hates Gamora is because was a never sister to her and that's all Nebula ever wanted.</li>
						
						<li>Overcome with guilt, Mantis confesses the truth to Drax</li>
						
						<li>No sooner than Nebula, Gamora, Mantis and Drax try to warn Quill does Quill learn that Ego's true ambition is to replicate his existence across the galaxy.  For this plan to work Ego needed a second Celestial being which is why he impregnated countless women across the galaxy and has had Yondu over the years bring him the children to be tested for the Celestial gene.  Peter almost goes along with Ego's plan until he discovers that Ego is the one responsible for the brain cancer which killed his mother.</li>
						
						<li>Rocket and Yondu arrive in a mining ship separate from the larger ship that Kraglin is flying.  The Guardians all climb aboard the mining ship and fly down to the planet's core so they can destroy Ego's true form: a brain at the center of the planet.</li>
						
						<li>As the Guardians are in the process of drilling into the planet's core, the Sovereign arrive.  The guardians stop drilling and Rocket uses the batteries he stole to make a bomb.  Rocket sends Baby Groot down to the planet's core to set the bomb off and destroy Ego's true form.  Encouraged by Drax, Mantis musters enough self-belief to force Ego to go to sleep.  Nebula plugs herself into the mining ship in order to take out all of the Sovereign ships in one shot.</li>
						
						<li>When Mantis is knocked unconscious, Ego wakes up and is almost successful in subduing Starlord until Yondu gives Starlord some advice which leads to Starlord gaining control over his Celestial power, saving his fellow Guardians and buying enough time for Groot to plant the bomb on Ego's brain, set the timer and escape.</li>
						
						<li>Rocket and Groot officially welcome Yondu to the Guardians of the Galaxy. Rocket gives Yondu his last rocket pack and oxygen-breathing device.</li>
						
						<li>All of the guardians successfully make it to the larger Ravager ship piloted by Kraglin except for Yondu who decides to stay behind and Starlord who is fighting Ego until the bomb detonates.</li>
						
						<li>When the bomb goes off, Ego dies and the planet begins to come apart, Yondu saves Starlord from the planet at the expense of his own life.  Starlord realizes that Yondu was the dad he wanted all along.</li>

					</ul>
					
					<h4>Character Events</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Since the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron, Thor has been unsuccessful in tracking down the Infinity Stones and finds himself imprisoned by the fire demon Surtur in Muspelheim</li>
						
						<li>Surtur reveals that Thor's father Odin is no longer on Asgard and that the realm will soon be destroyed in the prophesied Ragnarok once Surtur unites his crown with the Eternal Flame that burns in Odin's vault.  Thor defeats Surtur and takes Surtur's helmet back to Asgard believing he has prevent Ragnarok.</li>
						
						<li>Thor returns to Asgard to discover that Loki has been living the past two years pretending to be Odin and acting as the ruler of Asgard</li>
						
						<li>Thor reveals Loki's farce to the Asgardians and forces Loki to return to earth in order to locate their father. In the quest to find Odin, Doctor Strange meets Thor and helps Thor more quickly reunite with Odin </li>
						
						<li>Not long after Loki and Thor find Odin does Odin inform them that he is dying and that their long lost sister Hela will return from banishment and bring about Ragnarok once he dies.</li>
						
						<li>Odin passes away and Hela returns.</li>
						
						<li>Hela destroys Thor's hammer Mjolnir</li>
						
						<li>In their attempt to escape from Hela, Loki and Thor find themselves on a garbage planet known as Sakaar</li>
						
						<li>Hela arrives on Asgard, kills the Warriors Three, takes over Asgard and awakens her undead army with the Eternal Flame.</li>
											
						<li>Heimdall steals the sword which controls the Bifrost Bridge so that Hela can't use the Bifrost to reconquer the Nine Realms.  Heimdall also provides refuge for Asgardian citizens trying to find safety from Hela and her undead army.</li>
												
						<li>Loki, having arrived on Sakaar earlier than Thor, has already worked his way up the political ranks</li>
						
						<li>Without Mjolnir, Thor is subdued by a slave trader named Scrapper 142. Thor realizes shortly thereafter that Scrapper 142 is actually one of the Valkyrior, a legendary force of female warriors who were killed defending Asgard from Hela long ago.</li>

						<li>Thor's hair is cut and he is forced to be a gladiator where he shortly thereafter discovers that the Hulk has been fighting as their most famous gladiator since flying off to an unknown location at the end of Avengers: Age of Ultron.</li>
						
						<li>Having never changed back into Bruce Banner for two years, the Hulk has learned how to speak basic English.</li>
						
						<li>Thor tries to convince the Hulk to fight with him to take back Asgard but the Hulk is unwilling to give up his glory as a gladiator and instead wants Thor to stay.</li>
						
						<li>Thor escapes and finds the Quinjet which Hulk originally used to get to Sakaar.  Just behind Thor, Thor accidentally shows the last transmission from Black Widow. The video transforms Hulk back into Bruce Banner.  Thor tries to convince Bruce Banner to help him fight on Asgard.</li>
						
						<li>Loki and Scrapper 142 are tasked with bringing Thor and Hulk back into enslavement.  In the process Loki learns that Scrapper 142 is actually a Valkyrie and that she lost someone very special to her in the battle against Hela.  Reliving this event makes her decide to help Thor, and she captures Loki as a gesture.</li>
						
						<li>Thor, Loki, Bruce, Scrapper 142 stage a revolution on Sakaar and return to Asgard to confront Hela</li>
						
						<li>In the battle against Hela, Thor loses an eye and awakens his dormant power as the god of Thunder.</li>
						
						<li>Unable to defeat Hela, Thor enlists Loki to place Surtur's crown in the Eternal Flame and intentionally bring about Ragnarok. Along the way Loki pauses in front of the Tesseract in Odin's vault.</li>
						
						<li>Surtur is reborn, appears to destroy Hela and Asgard as well.  The remaining inhabitants of Asgard are rescued by Thor and fellow warriors from Sakaar</li>
						
						<li>Thor, now king of the Asgardian people, decides to take his people to Earth.  On their way they are intercepted by a large spacecraft.</li>
						
						
					</ul>
