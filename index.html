				The Marvel Cinematic Universe (often referred to as the MCU) is comprised of 20 interconnected movies (with more on the way), organized into three separate "phases," centered on the stories of over 20 different comic book characters (with more on the way) who originate in the pages of Marvel Comics
			</p>
			<p>
				While other movies have been made by different movie studios based on comic book characters who also originate in Marvel Comics, the MCU has thus far been the most successful attempt at creating a series of interconnected movies that both tell the individual stories of their characters while simultaneously connecting those stories to a larger narrative that expands across multiple movies
			</p>
			<p>
				The 15+ movies of the MCU are made by the Disney owned company, Marvel Studios. Marvel Studios is led by current president and all around awesome guy, Kevin Feige

						<li>Among the methods shared by Dr. Arnim Zola for advancing Hydra's cause, the most relevant for future MCU films were that:
							<ol>
								<li>Hydra has propagated their cause through strategic chaos inciting events like the covert assasination of Tony Stark's parents</li>
								<li>Hydra has been using the Winter Soldier as their primary means for advancing their cause</li>
							</ol>

						<li>During the above Captain America and team confront the Winter Soldier where they learn his true identity is Bucky Barnes (DUN DUN DUN!!!)</li>
						
						<li>Since Steve last saw Bucky Barnes, Bucky has been working as a brainwashed agent of Hydra under the codename of the Winter Soldier.

						<li>Captain America, Nick Fury, Black Widow, the Falcon and other various SHIELD agents work together to stop the launch of the upgraded Helicarriers</li>

						<li>Captain America risks his own life to try and break Bucky free from Hydra's brainwashing</li>
						
						<li>While Bucky doesn't break free from Hydra's influence, Bucky does go as far as saving Captain America from drowning in the Potomac River and is later seen again in a Captain America exhibit at the Smithsonian Institution trying to relearn his past</li>
						
						<li>After SHIELD is exposed as a nesting ground for Hydra, Black Widow appears before a senate subcommitte, Maria Hill joins Stark Enterprises, Captain America and The Falcon intend to track down Bucky Barnes, and Nick Fury -  thought to be dead at this time - goes off to Eastern Europe in pursuit of Hydra's remaining cells.</li>
						
						<li>In a post-credits scene we are given a glimpse inside of a Hydra base where it's implied that Loki's scepter was being used to create two super-power individuals who will come to be known as Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch</li>
